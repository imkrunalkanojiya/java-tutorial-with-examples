# Servlet Lifecycle: From Initialization to Destruction

## Servlet Lifecycle Overview

The servlet lifecycle is a systematic process that defines how a servlet is loaded, initialized, handles requests, and is ultimately destroyed. It consists of four primary stages:

### 1. Loading
- Servlet class is loaded by the web container
- Occurs when the first request is made or during server startup
- Can be configured with load-on-startup parameter

### 2. Initialization (`init()`)
- Called once when servlet is first loaded
- Used for one-time setup operations
- Prepares resources for servlet's lifecycle
- Called before the first request is processed

### 3. Request Handling (`service()`)
- Processes client requests
- Called for each incoming request
- Generates dynamic response
- Handles multiple concurrent requests

### 4. Destruction (`destroy()`)
- Called when servlet is being unloaded
- Performs cleanup operations
- Releases resources
- Typically occurs when application is shutting down

## Detailed Lifecycle Stages

### Initialization Method: `init()`
```java
public void init() throws ServletException {
    // One-time initialization
    // Open database connections
    // Load configuration
    // Initialize resources
}
```

#### Key Responsibilities
- Resource allocation
- Configuration loading
- Preparing servlet for request handling
- Occurs only once in servlet's lifetime

### Request Handling: `service()`
```java
public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) 
        throws ServletException, IOException {
    // Process incoming requests
    // Generate dynamic content
    // Handle different types of requests
}
```

#### Key Characteristics
- Called for each client request
- Handles request processing
- Generates response
- Multithreaded execution

### Destruction Method: `destroy()`
```java
public void destroy() {
    // Cleanup operations
    // Close database connections
    // Release resources
    // Perform final logging
}
```

#### Key Responsibilities
- Resource cleanup
- Closing open connections
- Performing final operations
- Graceful shutdown

## Lifecycle Sequence Diagram

```
[Servlet Class Loaded]
        ↓
[init() Method Called]
        ↓
[Multiple service() Calls]
        ↓
[destroy() Method Called]
```

## Lifecycle Method Characteristics

| Method | Frequency | Purpose | Typical Operations |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `init()` | Once | Initialization | Resource setup, configuration |
| `service()` | Multiple times | Request handling | Processing requests, generating responses |
| `destroy()` | Once | Cleanup | Releasing resources, final operations |

## Best Practices

1. Keep `init()` method lightweight
2. Minimize resource allocation in `service()`
3. Ensure thread-safety
4. Properly release resources in `destroy()`
5. Handle exceptions gracefully
6. Use logging for tracking lifecycle events

## Common Pitfalls

- Resource leaks
- Improper thread management
- Blocking operations in lifecycle methods
- Ignoring exception handling
- Not closing resources

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize initialization overhead
- Use connection pooling
- Implement efficient resource management
- Avoid heavy computations in lifecycle methods

## Thread Safety

- Servlet methods can be called by multiple threads simultaneously
- Implement thread-safe practices
- Use synchronized blocks or thread-local variables when necessary

## Advanced Configurations

- Load-on-startup parameter
- Configurable initialization
- Lazy loading vs. eager loading
- Servlet mapping and initialization order

## Logging and Monitoring

- Log lifecycle events
- Track servlet initialization time
- Monitor resource usage
- Implement performance metrics

## Modern Alternatives

- Reactive servlets
- Asynchronous servlet processing
- Microservices architecture
- Serverless computing
