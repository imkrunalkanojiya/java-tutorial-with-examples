# Let’s Write Code!

Here’s the fun part. Grab your JDK, fire up your IDE, and let’s write some Java!
- **Install the JDK and Set Up Environment Variables** – This is like setting up your base camp before an awesome coding adventure. Go to the official Oracle JDK download page, grab the JDK for your system, and follow the install steps. Don’t forget to set those environment variables so you’re ready to rock!
- **Write a Simple "Hello World" Java Program** – Let’s say "hello" to Java for the first time! Open your IDE and create a new Java project. Then, inside a class, type this:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
This little program will print “Hello, World!” to the screen like a mini firework show! 🎆

## Compile and Run the Program

Time to test it out!

### 1. Compile
Open a terminal (or command line), navigate to your program's folder, and type:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```

### 2. Run
Then, run your program with:

```bash
java HelloWorld
```

## Congrats, You’re a Java Pro Now!
Now that you've installed the JDK, set up your IDE, and run your first Java program, you’re ready to conquer the coding world! Keep practicing, and soon you’ll be building epic apps. 💪
