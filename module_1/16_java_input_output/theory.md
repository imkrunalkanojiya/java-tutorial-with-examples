# Opening the Floodgates of Data! 🌊

Java Input/Output (I/O) is like the plumbing system of your code — it handles data flow, whether you're reading user input, writing to files, or communicating over a network. Java I/O primarily revolves around Streams, which allow you to handle data streams flowing in and out of your programs.

## Streams in Java 🌊📖

Java uses Streams to perform I/O operations. There are two main types of streams:

- **InputStream**: Reads data from a source (e.g., file, network).
- **OutputStream**: Writes data to a destination (e.g., file, console).

## Reading and Writing Data Using Streams ✍️💻

Streams work on bytes or characters. For file handling, you typically work with classes like `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`, which handle byte streams, and `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`, which handle character streams.

- **InputStream**: Reads bytes.
- **OutputStream**: Writes bytes.
- **FileReader** / FileWriter: Used for reading and writing character data.
- **BufferedReader** / BufferedWriter: Provides efficient reading/writing by buffering input/output data.

## Handling File I/O Operations 📂

Java’s `java.io` package provides classes to perform file I/O operations. You can open a file, read or write data, and close the file when you're done. Common classes include:

- **FileInputStream**: Reads raw bytes from a file.
- **FileOutputStream**: Writes raw bytes to a file.
- **BufferedReader**: Reads text efficiently from a file.
- **BufferedWriter**: Writes text efficiently to a file.
