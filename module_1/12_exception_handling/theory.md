# ðŸŽ¯ Oops! Something Went Wrongâ€¦ But We Can Fix It!

Errors are like those unexpected roadblocks in a video gameâ€”they pop up at the worst times. But fear not! Java has a cool system for handling them: Exception Handling. By catching and managing exceptions, we can keep our programs running smoothly even when things go wrong.

## Types of Exceptions â€“ The Two Troublemakers!

There are two main types of exceptions in Java:

### 1. Checked Exceptions (Compile-Time Exceptions):

These are the exceptions that Java forces you to handle at compile-time. If you donâ€™t, your program wonâ€™t even compile! Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`, and `FileNotFoundException`.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileReader reader = new FileReader("non_existent_file.txt");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught IOException: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):

These exceptions occur during the execution of the program and can be ignored at compile-time. However, it's good practice to handle them! Common examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and `ArithmeticException`.

```java
public class DivisionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 5;
        int divisor = 0;

        try {
            int result = num / divisor;  // Will throw ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught ArithmeticException: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## The Exception Handling Block Party: `try, catch, finally, throw, throws`

### 1. try and catch â€“ Error Catchers!

The try block is where you "try" to run code that could throw an exception. If an exception occurs, itâ€™s caught by the catch block, which handles it gracefully without crashing the program.

```java
public class TryCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(numbers[5]);  // Will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. finally â€“ Cleaning Up the Mess!

The `finally` block always executes, whether an exception was thrown or not. It's typically used for resource cleanup, like closing files or database connections.

```java
public class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Caught an exception");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block always executes!");
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. throw â€“ Throwing Custom Exceptions!

The `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception manually. You can use it to create your own exception or throw a standard Java exception.

```java
public class ThrowExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("You canâ€™t divide by zero here!");
    }
}
```

### 4. throws â€“ Passing the Buck!

The `throws` keyword is used in method declarations to indicate that a method can throw one or more exceptions. If a method is likely to throw an exception but doesnâ€™t handle it, it must declare the exception using `throws`.

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class ThrowsExample {
    public static void riskyMethod() throws IOException {
        throw new IOException("File not found!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            riskyMethod();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Custom Exception Classes â€“ Creating Your Own Trouble!

Sometimes, the built-in exceptions donâ€™t quite fit the bill. That's where custom exceptions come in! You can define your own exception class to handle specific scenarios in your program.

### Creating a Custom Exception:

Create your custom exception by extending the `Exception` class (or `RuntimeException` for unchecked exceptions).

```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

### Using Custom Exception:

Now, you can use your custom exception like any other exception!

```java
public class CustomExceptionDemo {
    static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be at least 18!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age is valid!");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(16);  // This will throw InvalidAgeException
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught custom exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
